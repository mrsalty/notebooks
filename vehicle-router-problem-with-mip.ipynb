    "We have $m$ couriers that must distribute $n ≥ m$ items at different customer locations. Each courier $i$ has a maximum load size $l$i. Each item $j$ has a distribution point $j$ and a size $s_j$ (which can represent for instance a weight or a volume). The goal of VCP is to decide for each courier the items to be distributed and plan a tour (i.e. a sequence of location points to visit) to perform the necessary distribution tasks. Each courier tour must start and end at a given origin point o. Moreover, the maximum load $li$ of the courier $i$ should be respected when items are assigned to it. To achieve a fair division among drivers, the objective is to minimize the maximum distance travelled by any courier.\n",
